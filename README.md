- 👋 Hi, I’m @Christos-Developer
- 👀 I’m interested in developinhg a few different fun Mobile App's to hopefully give the people of today that bit of nourtouring loving guidance that many of us did not get in our youth.
- 🌱 I’m currently now, even though I have spent the last 16 years in pretty heavy duty studies, am now having to learn even more in doing this, learning to write the script for both the software layer and presentation layer to develope those apps in this world wide web consortium.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me accomplish this, and also in return if I can provide answers for you as well I will do what I can, and if I not certain I will let you know as well with all the degrees of certifications I have, the highest levels are Diplomas so I do not know it all.
- 📫 The best way to reach myself is via email at canton_65@live.com.au  And please, I emplore you, I have far better things to be doing with my time than just sitting there deleting spam emails and scamming emails, which I consider to be a denial of service attack, so I am certain you don't like it, so dont dish out what you do not like recieving please, I think the world would be a better place, as our reality that we live collectively is no more than a resulting equation of how we all treat each other.
